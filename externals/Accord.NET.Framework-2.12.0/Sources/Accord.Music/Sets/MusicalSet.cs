    ///   Musical set theory deals with collections of pitches and pitch classes, which
    ///   may be ordered or unordered, and which can be related by musical operations
    ///   such as transposition, inversion, and complementation. The methods of musical
    ///   set theory are sometimes applied to the analysis of rhythm as well.
